This is a simple android application which display images taken in Space and its information.
We parse JSON data from the Json file placed in asset folder and display the images and the associated data in a list;

Tech Stack:
- This app is developed in Kotlin
- I used MVVM architecture to develop the app (androidx lifecycle components)
- Coroutines for async programming
- Koin for dependency injection
- Glide for image loading
- Lottie for animation
- I have also utilized Kotlin's extension functions, sealed classes, etc., for efficiency.
